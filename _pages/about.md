My name is Naman and I'm in my senior year of study pursuing engineering from GGSIPU. What drives me is DATA. I love to play with Data and the most fun part, the story it tells.

I believe in continous learning and so, keep exploring every technical field. I have explored every field from Blockchain to Deep Learning. I have created a few decentralised applications on Ethereum, full stack apps and done data analysis. I have created some really cool projects using Computer Vision technology some of which include American Sign Language Detection etc. Check out my links to know more about me.
