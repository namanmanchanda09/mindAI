My name is Naman and I'm in my senior year of study pursuing engineering from GGSIPU. What drives me is DATA. I love to play with Data and the most fun part, the story it tells.

I believe in continous learning and so, keep exploring every technical field. I have explored every field from Blockchain to Deep Learning. I have created a few decentralised applications on Ethereum, full stack apps and done data analysis. I have created some really cool projects using Computer Vision technology some of which include American Sign Language Detection etc. Check out my links to know more about me.

Here's a list of my project :- 

1. [Instagram Clone](https://github.com/namanmanchanda09/InstaCloneFirebase)
    This is a minimal Instagram clone for iOS made using Swift and Firebase. It allows sign in, sign out, posting images to feed, post upvotes and logout.

2. [WorkTrack](https://github.com/namanmanchanda09/WorkTrack)
    The simplest iOS work tracker. This is a minimal native to-do list application implemented using Swift and Firebase. It allows adding to-dos, deleting and accessing them.

3. [ASL Detection](https://github.com/namanmanchanda09/American-Sign-Language-Detection-using-Computer-Vision)
    The project consists of American Sign Language Translator to English language. It uses Computer Vision and Deep Learning to predict the ASL alphabet and forms sentences on the basis of prediction. It uses text to speech to convert the predicted word into speech. The project was implemented at MNNIT Hack36 Allahabad Hackathon.

4. [Decentralised Social Network](https://github.com/namanmanchanda09/Decentralised-Social-Network-on-Ethereum)
    This is a decentralised social network built on Ethereum using Truffle. It allows users with a Metamask wallet to read posts, write posts and tip posts. The best posts gets rewarded from other users.

I've published a research paper titled `Predicting and improving entrepreneurial competency in University Students using ML algorithms` at IEEE Xplore which can be found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9058292).
